abstract = {We present 'empirical' models (pressure vs. density) of Saturn's interior constrained by the gravitational coefficients J2, J4, and J6 for different assumed rotation rates of the planet. The empirical pressure-density profile is interpreted in terms of a hydrogen and helium physical equation of state to deduce the hydrogen to helium ratio in Saturn and to constrain the depth dependence of helium and heavy element abundances. The planet's internal structure (pressure vs. density) and composition are found to be insensitive to the assumed rotation rate for periods between 10h:32m:35s and 10h:41m:35s. We find that helium is depleted in the upper envelope, while in the high pressure region (P ≳ 1   Mbar) either the helium abundance or the concentration of heavier elements is significantly enhanced. Taking the ratio of hydrogen to helium in Saturn to be solar, we find that the maximum mass of heavy elements in Saturn's interior ranges from ∼6 to 20 M⊕. The empirical models of Saturn's interior yield a moment of inertia factor varying from 0.22271 to 0.22599 for rotation periods between 10h:32m:35s and 10h:41m:35s, respectively. A long-term precession rate of about 0.754″   yr-1 is found to be consistent with the derived moment of inertia values and assumed rotation rates over the entire range of investigated rotation rates. This suggests that the long-term precession period of Saturn is somewhat shorter than the generally assumed value of 1.77 × 106 years inferred from modeling and observations. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Using astrometric observations spanning more than a century and including a large set of Cassini data, we determine Saturn's tidal parameters through their current effects on the orbits of the eight main and four coorbital Moons. We have used the latter to make the first determination of Saturn's Love number from observations, k2=0.390 ± 0.024, a value larger than the commonly used theoretical value of 0.341 (Gavrilov & Zharkov, 1977), but compatible with more recent models (Helled & Guillot, 2013) for which the static k2 ranges from 0.355 to 0.382. Depending on the assumed spin for Saturn's interior, the new constraint can lead to a significant reduction in the number of potential models, offering great opportunities to probe the planet's interior. In addition, significant tidal dissipation within Saturn is confirmed (Lainey et al., 2012) corresponding to a high present-day tidal ratio k2/Q=(1.59 ± 0.74) × 10−4 and implying fast orbital expansions of the Moons. This high dissipation, with no obvious variations for tidal frequencies corresponding to those of Enceladus and Dione, may be explained by viscous friction in a solid core, implying a core viscosity typically ranging between 1014 and 1016 Pa.s (Remus et al., 2012). However, a dissipation increase by one order of magnitude at Rhea's frequency could suggest the existence of an additional, frequency-dependent, dissipation process, possibly from turbulent friction acting on tidal waves in the fluid envelope of Saturn (Ogilvie & Lin, 2004; Fuller et al. 2016).},

In particular, we calculate the electrical and thermal conductivity, the shear and longitudinal viscosity, and diffusion coefficients of the nuclei. We present results for associated quantities like the magnetic and thermal diffusivity and the kinematic shear viscosity along an adiabat that is taken from a state-of-the-art interior structure model. Furthermore, the heat capacities, the thermal expansion coefficient, the isothermal compressibility, the Gr{\"{u}}neisen parameter, and the speed of sound are calculated. We find that the onset of dissociation and ionization of hydrogen at about 0.9 Jupiter radii marks a region where the material properties change drastically. In the deep interior, where the electrons are degenerate, many of the material properties remain relatively constant. Our ab initio data will serve as a robust foundation for applications that require accurate knowledge of the material properties in Jupiter's interior, e.g., models for the dynamo generation. {\textcopyright} {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {We discuss our current understanding of the interior structure and thermal evolution of giant planets. This includes the gas giants, such as Jupiter and Saturn, that are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, as well as the "ice giants," such as Uranus and Neptune, which are primarily composed of elements heavier than H/He. The effect of different hydrogen equations of state (including new first-principles computations) on Jupiter's core mass and heavy element distribution is detailed. This variety of the hydrogen equations of state translate into an uncertainty in Jupiter's core mass of 18M ⊙ . For Uranus and Neptune we find deep envelope metallicities up to 0.95, perhaps indicating the existence of an eroded core, as also supported by their low luminosity. We discuss the results of simple cooling models of our solar system's planets, and show that more complex thermal evolution models may be necessary to understand their cooling history. We review how measurements of the masses and radii of the nearly 50 transiting extrasolar giant planets are changing our understanding of giant planets. In particular a fraction of these planets appear to be larger than can be accommodated by standard models of planetary contraction. We review the proposed explanations for the radii of these planets. We also discuss very young giant planets, which are being directly imaged with ground- and space-based telescopes. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {We present a review of Saturn's interior structure and thermal evolution, with a particular focus on work in the past 5 years. Data from the Cassini mission, including a precise determination of the gravity field from the Grand Finale orbits, and the still ongoing identification of ring wave features in Saturn's C-ring tied to seismic modes in the planet, have led to dramatic advances in our understanding of Saturn's structure. Models that match the gravity field suggest that differential rotation, as seen in the visible atmosphere, extends down to at least a depth of 10,000 km (1/6$^{\rm th}$ the planet's radius). At greater depths, a variety of different investigations all now point to a deep Saturn rotation rate of 10 hours and 33 minutes. There is very compelling evidence for a central heavy element concentration (``core''), that in most recent models is 12-20 Earth masses. Ring seismology strongly suggests that the core is not entirely compact, but is dilute (mixed in with the overlying H/He), and has a substantial radial extent, perhaps out to around one-half of the planet's radius. A wide range of thermal evolution scenarios can match the planet's current luminosity, with progress on better quantifying the helium rain scenario hampered by Saturn's poorly known atmospheric helium abundance. We discuss the relevance of magnetic field data on understanding the planet's current interior structure. We point towards additional future work that combines seismology and gravity within a framework that includes differential rotation, and the utility of a Saturn entry probe.},

abstract = {Conventional evolutionary models for Jupiter and Saturn, which assume convection throughout the entire planet interior, yield ages of 5.1 Gyr for Jupiter and 2.6 Gyr for Saturn. Even though the discrepancy for Saturn can be explained by the additional energy source due to a phase separation of helium, it seems difficult to reconcile the age of fully convective Jovian models with the age of the solar system, i.e., 4.5 Gyr. It has been recently shown that these planets are probably not fully convective, but retain a stable radiative window near the surface. We present new evolutionary models for these two planets, which do include the aforementioned possibility of radiative transport in the molecular hydrogen-helium envelope. These calculations yield ages of 4.2 Gyr for Jupiter and 2.4 Gyr for Saturn. We show that the importance of the radiative window was larger in the past than now, so that the ratio of the radiative to the adiabatic gradient in the radiative region increases with time. This speeds up the cooling with respect to a fully adiabatic planet. Since the interiors of the new Jupiter and Saturn models are significantly cooler than the adiabatic ones, it is likely that immiscibility of helium occurs in both planets. That provides a natural explanation for the observed helium depletion in their atmospheres and the fact that the ages inferred from homogeneous evolution models of these two planets are smaller than the age of the solar system.},

abstract = {Interior models of Uranus and Neptune often assume discrete layers, but sharp interfaces are expected only if major constituents are immiscible. Diffuse interfaces could arise if accretion favored a central concentration of the least volatile constituents (also, incidentally, the most dense); compositional gradients arising in such a structure would likely inhibit convection. Currently, two lines of evidence suggest possible hydrogen–water immiscibility in ice giant interiors. The first arises from crude extrapolation of the experimental H2–H2O critical curve to ∼3 GPa. The data are obtained for an impure system containing silicates, though Uranus and Neptune could also be “dirty.” Current ab initio models disagree (Soubiran & Militzer 2015), though hydrogen and water are difficult to model from first-principles quantum mechanics with the necessary precision. The second argument for H2–H2O immiscibility in ice giants, outlined herein, invokes reasoning about the gravitational and magnetic fields. While consensus remains lacking, here we examine the immiscible case. Applying the resulting thermodynamic constraints, we find that Neptune models with envelopes containing a substantial water mole fraction, as much as c¢env ≳ 0.1 relative to hydrogen, can satisfy observations. In contrast, Uranus models appear to require c¢env ≲ 0.01, potentially suggestive of fully demixed hydrogen and water. Enough gravitational potential energy would be available from gradual hydrogen–water demixing to supply Neptune's present-day heat flow for roughly 10 solar system lifetimes. Hydrogen–water demixing could slow Neptune's cooling rate by an order of magnitude; different hydrogen–water demixing states could account for the different heat flows of Uranus and Neptune.},

The calculations combine the EOS of Saumon, Chabrier & vanHorn (1995) in the low density, low temperature molecular/atomic domain, the EOS of Chabrier & Potekhin (1998) in the high-density, high-temperature fully ionized domain, the limits of which differ for H and He, and ab initio quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) calculations in the intermediate density and temperature regime, characteristic of pressure dissociation and ionization. The EOS for the H/He mixture is based on the so-called additive volume law and thus does not take into account the interactions between the two species. A major improvement of the present calculations over existing ones is that we calculate the entropy over the entire density-temperature domain, a necessary quantity for stellar or planetary evolution calculations. The EOS results are compared with existing experimental data, namely Hugoniot shock experiments for pure H and He, and with first principle numerical simulations for both the single elements and the mixture. This new EOS covers a wide range of physical and astrophysical conditions, from jovian planets to solar-type stars, and recovers the existing relativistic EOS at very high densities, in the domains of white dwarfs and neutron stars.},

abstract = {<p>The contrasting internal luminosity of Uranus and Neptune present a challenge to our understanding of the origin and evolution of these bodies, as well as extra-solar ice giants. The thermal evolution of Neptune is known to be nearly consistent with an entirely fluid interior, but this is not a unique solution, and does not account for the tidal dissipation required by the migration of its moons. We examine a model that has been previously shown to explain the thermal and tidal evolution of Uranus: one that features a growing, frozen core. The core traps heat in the interior, affecting the cooling time scale, and provides a source of tidal dissipation. We review the growing, frozen core model, and the computation of thermal and tidal evolution. We then apply this model to Neptune. We find that the growing frozen core model can account for the observed internal luminosity of Neptune and the migration of its moons, in the form of resonances that were either encountered or avoided in the past. We discuss prospects for observational tests of the growing frozen core model and possible implications for understanding the gas giants.</p>},

U\sim has dimensions of force and may be viewed as an effective line tension acting on the wall locally tangent to it. The effective normal force per unit length, f, will be f = U\sim/\sim where r is the local radius of curvature. The disclination wall will move under this force which in steady state will be balanced by a. viscous force per unit length, f"= Pr,-arising because motion of the wall past a point on the film is accompanied by dissipative molecular rotation. Equating the two forces gives the equation r(t) = (U"/-P)/r(t) for the local motion of a wall. This yields r'(f) = (2U\sim/P)(t,-f) for a circular loop which is what we observe. Detailed calculation shows that P=8q/(where g is a 2D orien-tational viscosity. Hence the collapse rate constant U\sim/P=K/q independent of E. Our experimental results for K/q, obtained from the slope of the r\sim vs (t,-t) curves, are K/q=9. 2 (N=2), 7.3 (N=3), 6.2 (N=4), and 5.0 (N= 5); all are a1.0 in units of 10 ' cm'/sec.

With use of a Lagrangian which allows for the variation of the shape and size of the periodically repeating molecular-dynamics cell, it is shown that different pair potentials lead to different crystal structures. on homogeneous nucleation of a crystal out of a supercooled liquid phase have shown that the structure of the nucleated phase does depend on the pair potential. These calculations are time consuming because of the long-lived, glassy, metastable states which the system has to inhabit before nucleating. Here we present a very direct and relatively short calculation which relates the crystal structure to the pair potential in a simple manner. Andersen has shown how MD calculations can be modified to study systems under constant pressure by introducing the volume of the system as an additional dynamical variable. In this paper we show how a generalization of this idea leads to a powerful method for the study of crystal structures and their relation to pair potentials. We have performed MD calculations with a time-dependent metric tensor which allows the volume and the shape of the MD cell to vary with time. Let the edges of the MD cell be a, 5, and c (in a space-fixed coordinate system), and let them be time dependent. Periodically repeating MD cells will obviously fill up all space. Let h be the matrix formed by fa, b, c); 0 = deth-= a \sim b x},

abstract = {A new Lagrangian formulation is introduced. It can be used to make molecular dynamics (MD) calculations on systems under the most general, externally applied, conditions of stress. In this formulation the MD cell shape and size can change according to dynamical equations given by this Lagrangian. This new MD technique is well suited to the study of structural transformations in solids under external stress and at finite temperature. As an example of the use of this technique we show how a single crystal of Ni behaves under uniform uniaxial compressive and tensile loads. This work confirms some of the results of static (i.e., zero temperature) calculations reported in the literature. We also show that some results regarding the stress-strain relation obtained by static calculations are invalid at finite temperature. We find that, under compressive loading, our model of Ni shows a bifurcation in its stress-strain relation; this bifurcation provides a link in configuration space between cubic and hexagonal close packing. It is suggested that such a transformation could perhaps be observed experimentally under extreme conditions of shock.},

The equation of state data, the Hugoniot, and a ramp compression curve are computed and compared to earlier results from diamond anvil cell and (decaying) shock wave experiments. In addition, the dynamical electrical conductivity and the reflectivity along the experimental Hugoniot curve are calculated in order to characterize electronic structure changes under compression. The structural properties of MgO are identified using pair correlation functions and self-diffusion coefficients. The solid-solid coexistence line is calculated by comparing the free enthalpies of the B1 and the B2 phase. The free energy of the solid phases is determined via thermodynamic relations using the ab initio simulation results and phonon calculations in the harmonic approximation. Our results indicate that the solid B2 phase of MgO does not occur in the interior of the Earth but may play an important role in super-Earths and in rocky planetary cores. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

After testing several EOS models based on the Mie-Gr{\"{u}}neisen-Debye description for the thermal pressures with the Vinet and the third-order Birch-Murnaghan equations for the 300-K isothermal compression, we determined the K'T0 and $\gamma$(V) using a new functional form $\gamma$ = $\gamma$0{1 + a[(V/V0)b -1]} to express the volume dependence of the Gr{\"{u}}neisen parameter. Through least squares analyses with prerequisite zero-pressure and room temperature properties of V0, KS0, $\alpha$0, and CP0, we simultaneously optimized a set of parameters K'T0, $\gamma$0, a, and b required to represent the P-FTEOS. Determined new EOS models of MgO successfully reproduced all the analyzed P-V-T-Ks data up to 196 GPa and 3700 K within the uncertainties, and the total residuals between calculated and observed pressures were found to be 0.8 GPa in root mean squares. These EOS models, even though very simple, are able to reproduce available data quite accurately in the wide pressure-temperature range and completely independent from other pressure scales. We propose these models for primary pressure calibration standards applicable to quantitative high-pressure and high-temperature experiments. Copyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.},

@article{Karki2001,
abstract = {The elasticity of materials is important for our understanding of processes ranging from brittle failure, to flexure, to the propagation of elastic waves. Seismologically revealed structure of the Earth's mantle, including the radial (one-dimensional) profile, lateral heterogeneity, and anisotropy are determined largely by the elasticity of the materials that make up this region. Despite its importance to geophysics, our knowledge of the elasticity of potentially relevant mineral phases at conditions typical of the Earth's mantle is still limited: Measuring the elastic constants at elevated pressure-temperature conditions in the laboratory remains a major challenge. Over the past several years, another approach has been developed based on first-principles quantum mechanical theory. First-principles calculations provide the ideal complement to the laboratory approach because they require no input from experiment; that is, there are no free parameters in the theory. Such calculations have true predictive power and can supply critical information including that which is difficult to measure experimentally. A review of high-pressure theoretical studies of major mantle phases shows a wide diversity of elastic behavior among important tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated Mg and Ca silicates and Mg, Ca, Al, and Si oxides. This is particularly apparent in the acoustic anisotropy, which is essential for understanding the relationship between seismically observed anisotropy and mantle flow. The acoustic anisotropy of the phases studied varies from zero to more than 50% and is found to depend on pressure strongly, and in some cases nonmonotonically. For example, the anisotropy in MgO decreases with pressure up to 15 GPa before increasing upon further compression, reaching 50% at a pressure of 130 GPa. Compression also has a strong effect on the elasticity through pressure-induced phase transitions in several systems. For example, the transition from stishovite to CaCl<inf>2</inf> structure in silica is accompanied by a discontinuous change in the shear (S) wave velocity that is so large (60%) that it may be observable seismologically. Unifying patterns emerge as well: Eulerian finite strain theory is found to provide a good description of the pressure dependence of the elastic constants for most phases. This is in contrast to an evaluation of Birch's law, which shows that this systematic accounts only roughly for the effect of pressure, composition, and structure on the longitudinal (P) wave velocity. The growing body of theoretical work now allows a detailed comparison with seismological observations. The athermal elastic wave velocities of most important mantle phases are found to be higher than the seismic wave velocities of the mantle by amounts that are consistent with the anticipated effects of temperature and iron content on the P and S wave velocities of the phases studied. An examination of future directions focuses on strategies for extending first-principles studies to more challenging but geophysically relevant situations such as solid solutions, high-temperature conditions, and mineral composites.},

abstract = {Atomic-scale materials modelling based on first-principles quantum mechanics is playing an important role in the science of the Earth and the other planets. We outline the basic theory of this kind of modelling and explain how it can be applied in a variety of different ways to probe the thermodynamics, structure and transport properties of both solids and liquids under extreme conditions. After a summary of the density functional formulation of quantum mechanics and its practical implementation through pseudopotentials, we outline the simplest way of applying first-principles modelling, namely static zero-temperature calculations. We show how calculations of this kind can be compared with static compression experiments to demonstrate the accuracy of first-principles modelling at pressures reached in planetary interiors. Noting that virtually all problems concerning planetary interiors require an understanding of materials at high temperatures as well as high pressures, we then describe how first-principles lattice dynamics gives a powerful way of investigating solids at temperatures not too close to the melting line. We show how such calculations have contributed to important progress, including the recent discovery of the post-perovskite phase of MgSiO3 in the D′′ layer at the base of the Earth's mantle. A range of applications of first-principles molecular dynamics are then reviewed, including the properties of metallic hydrogen in Jupiter and Saturn, of water, ammonia and methane in Uranus and Neptune, and of oxides and silicates and solid and liquid iron and its alloys in the Earth's deep interior. Recognizing the importance of phase equilibria throughout the planetary sciences, we review recently developed techniques for the first-principles calculation of solid and liquid free energies, melting curves and chemical potentials of alloys. We show how such calculations have contributed to an improved understanding of the temperature distribution and the chemical composition throughout the Earth's interior. The review concludes with a summary of the present state of the field and with some ideas for future developments. {\textcopyright} 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.},
